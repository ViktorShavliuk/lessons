			<h2>Now let's look at them in more detail</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3 id="part_1">Signal Hill</h3>
					<img title="Signal Hill" src="img/signal_hill.jpg" alt="signal hill">
					<P><mark>Signal Hill</mark> is well known as the site where the era of mass communication was born. In
						1901, Guglielmo
						Marconi suspended an antenna 500 feet above the hill with a kite and received the first transatlantic
						wireless signal – the letter S (three short beeps) in Morse code.</P>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3 id="part_2">Row Houses</h3>
					<img title="Row Houses" src="img/row_houses.webp" alt="Row Houses">
					<p>Colourful is a term thrown around the travel-writing world like so much clichéd confetti.
						But the “painted ladies” of San Francisco, terraces of stately and vividly clad Victorian houses, and
						the “jelly-bean” <mark>row houses</mark> of St. John's transcend the hackneyed with their splashy
						paint schemes.
						Indeed, no less than the New York Times has described the hilly streets, artsy vibe and sweeping
						harbour views of the Newfoundland capital as a “smaller but earthier” version of the Northern
						California tech hub.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3 id="part_3">Cabot Tower on Signal Hill</h3>
					<img title="Cabot Tower" src="img/cabot_tower.jpg" alt="Cabot Tower">
					<p><mark>Cabot Tower</mark> is a tower in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, situated on Signal Hill.
						Construction
						of the tower began in 1898 to commemorate the 400th anniversary of John Cabot's landing in
						Newfoundland, and Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3 id="part_4">Basilica of St.John's the Baptist</h3>
					<img title="Basilica of St.John's" src="img/basilica_cathedral.jpg" alt="Basilica Cathedral">
					<p>The <mark>Basilica-Cathedral</mark> of St. John the Baptist in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador
						is the
						metropolitan cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. John's, Newfoundland and the mother
						church and symbol of Roman Catholicism in Newfoundland.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3 id="part_5">the Confederation Building</h3>
					<img title="Confederation Building" src="img/confederation_building.jpg" alt="Confederation Building">
					<p>The <mark>Confederation Building</mark> serves as the home of the Newfoundland and Labrador House of
						Assembly. It
						is located on Confederation Hill overlooking Newfoundland and Labrador's capital city, St. John's. The
						brick- and concrete-clad building <span>has 11 stories and</span> is 64 metres tall.
